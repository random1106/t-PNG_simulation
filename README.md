# tPNG_simulation
The simulation is done by Python, which simulates the deformed PolyNuclear Growth model with different parameters. 

The file simulation.py provides a visulization of the model. 

The file height.py simulates the height function in large scale and compare it with the theoretical limit. 

The result of the simulation can also be found https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11158.pdf
